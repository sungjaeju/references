Building the JAX-RPC library for JDK 21 is challenging due to the significant changes and deprecations that have occurred in the Java ecosystem, especially since JAX-RPC has been replaced by JAX-WS and other modern web service frameworks.

Here are the steps and considerations you need to take into account if you still want to attempt it:

1. Understand JAX-RPC Deprecation
JAX-RPC has been deprecated for a long time and is no longer actively supported. JAX-WS is the recommended alternative.
JAX-RPC was part of the older Java EE (now Jakarta EE), and many of its components have been removed or replaced in newer versions of Java SE and EE.
2. Evaluate Migration to JAX-WS
Before trying to build JAX-RPC with JDK 21, consider migrating your application to JAX-WS. JAX-WS is the successor of JAX-RPC and offers more features, better performance, and active support.
3. Compatibility Issues with JDK 21
JDK 21 has removed many older modules and features that JAX-RPC might depend on, including the JAXB and JAX-WS modules which were removed in JDK 11. You'll need to manually add these modules back as dependencies if you're building with a newer JDK.
4. Adding Required Dependencies
You can add the necessary dependencies using Maven or Gradle. Here's an example of adding them via Maven:
xml
Copy code
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>jakarta.xml.bind</groupId>
        <artifactId>jakarta.xml.bind-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.3.3</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.glassfish.jaxb</groupId>
        <artifactId>jaxb-runtime</artifactId>
        <version>2.3.3</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>jakarta.xml.ws</groupId>
        <artifactId>jakarta.xml.ws-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.3.3</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.sun.xml.ws</groupId>
        <artifactId>jaxws-rt</artifactId>
        <version>2.3.3</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
5. Building JAX-RPC
If you still want to proceed with JAX-RPC, you may need to download the source code of JAX-RPC and attempt to build it using JDK 21.
You might need to resolve many compatibility issues manually. This could involve code changes and ensuring all dependencies are compatible with the latest JDK.
Example Steps:
Clone the JAX-RPC Repository:

If there's a repository available, clone it. Otherwise, you might need to find the JAX-RPC source code from older archives.
Update Dependencies:

Ensure the pom.xml or build.gradle file includes all necessary dependencies compatible with JDK 21.
Build the Project:

Use Maven or Gradle to build the project. For Maven, use mvn clean install. For Gradle, use gradle build.
Resolve Issues:

Address any compilation or runtime issues that arise. This might involve code modifications, adding missing libraries, or configuring the build system correctly.
Conclusion
While technically possible, building JAX-RPC for JDK 21 is complex and generally not recommended due to its deprecated status and the availability of better alternatives like JAX-WS. If you are maintaining legacy code, consider migrating to JAX-WS or other modern web service frameworks to ensure better compatibility and support.
